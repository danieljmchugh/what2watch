# WHAT2WATCH

WHAT2WATCH is a personal project of mine to help develope full stack shenanigans. The website functionality will be to sort out those moments of not being able to decide on a movie to watch with friends or family. Ideas and features for the site will be added as it is developed.

Website design ideas:
    - User profiles
    - Personal movie lists
    - Merge with other users lists
    - Randomly recommend movie

TODOs:
- [x] START WORKING
