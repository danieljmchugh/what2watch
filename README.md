#WHAT2WATCH

WHAT2WATCH is a personal project of mine to help develop skills for a full stack developer. The aim of the website is to sort out those moments of not being able to decide on a movie to watch with friends or family. Ideas and features for the site will be added as it is developed.

Website design:
    - User profiles
    - Personal movie lists
    - Merge with other users lists
        - Select from overlap
    - Randomly select movie based on: genre, "mood", released, rating, etc.
