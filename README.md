# WHAT2WATCH

WHAT2WATCH is a personal project of mine to help develop full stack shenanigans.
The website functionality will be to sort out those moments of not being able to
decide on a movie to watch with friends or family. Ideas and features for the
site will be added as it is developed.

## Technologies:

-   Frontend

    -   React
    -   Typescript
    -   Redux for statemanagement?
    -   Some CSS TBD

-   Backend
    -   database: mySQL
    -   Server side:
        -   TBD: node.js, flask, etc.
        -   Node.js for now as i am follwing the fullstack course at:
            https://fullstackopen.com/en/
        -   (HOWEVER: i do kinda wanna tryout flask, so we will see down the
            line)

## Website design ideas:
